        <h2>Lorem Ipusm</h2>
        <p id="para1">My name is Victoria Winters. My journey is beginning - a journey that I hope will open the doors of life and link my past with my future. A journey that will bring me to a dark place to the edge of the sea high atop Widow's Hill; and a house called
            Collinwood. A world never known, with people I've never met. People who, tonight, are still only shadows in my mind but who will soon fill the days and nights of my tomorrow...</p>

        <p>This is Herman Brooks. Herman is just like the rest of us. Everyday he has to make all kinds of decisions like what to wear, whom to date and when to panic. Now these decisions should be easy but if you take a look inside Herman's head, you'll
            see why he sometimes has trouble making up his mind. Sometimes they agree... usually they don't. But the struggle is going on inside all of us and it's all going on inside Herman's head.</p>

        <p>Sometimes the world looks perfect, nothing to rearrange. Sometimes you just, get a feeling like you need some kind of change. No matter what the odds are this time, nothing's going to stand in my way. This flame in my heart, and a long lost friend
            gives every dark street a light at the end. Standing tall, on the wings of my dream. Rise and fall, on the wings of my dream. The rain and thunder, the wind and haze. I'm bound for better days. It's my life and my dream, nothing's going to
            stop me now.</p>

        <p>They arrived in fifty mother ships, offering their friendship and advance technology to Earth. Skeptical of the visitors, Mike Donovan and Juliet Parrish infiltrated their ranks and soon discovered some startling secrets. The resistance is all
            that stands between us... and the visitors.</p>

        <p>Hey, hey, hey! It's Fat Albert! Now I'm gonna sing a song for you, and this is gonna show you a thing or two. You'll have some fun now With me and the gang, learning from each other While we do our thing. Na na na gonna have a good time! Na na
            na gonna have a good time! Hey, hey, hey! This is Bill Cosby coming out with music and fun and if you're not careful, you may learn something before it's done! Hey, hey, hey!</p>
