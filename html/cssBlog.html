      <p> On November 21, Felix Unger was asked to remove himself from his place of residence. That request came from his wife. Deep down, he knew she was right, but he also knew that someday, he would return to her. With nowhere else to go, he appeared at the home of his childhood friend, Oscar Madison. Sometime earlier, Madison's wife had thrown him out, requesting that he never return. Can two divorced men share an apartment without driving each other crazy?</p>

      <p> Don't go to bed, with no price on your head. No, no, don't do it. Fon't do the crime, if you can't do the time, yeah, don't do it. And keep your eye on the sparrow, when the going gets narrow. Don't do it, don't do it. Where can I go where the cold winds don't blow, Now. Well, well, well.</p>
